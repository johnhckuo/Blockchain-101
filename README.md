# Smart Contract Manipulation
A tutorial for Solidity newbies :)

###Introduction
`This tutorial uses solidity ^0.4.2, but it is also compatible with solidity ^0.4.0 or higher version.`


This tutorial contains five parts:
> 1. Basic Introduction
> 2. Inheritance
> 3. Modifiers
> 4. Variables
> 5. Contract Interactions
> 6. Oracle Service

This tutorial I will focus on the back-end solidity part, and will update the web.js and front-end parts in the future.

For the convenience of quick development, Solidity online compiler might help you a lot！
